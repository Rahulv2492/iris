				<p>My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
What day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time;
Therefore, since <a href="#">brevity is the soul of wit</a>,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.</p>
